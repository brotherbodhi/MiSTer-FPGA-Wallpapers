1920x1080 Wallpapers for MiSTer FPGA

Here are some wallpapers I have been making for the MiSTer. I am a big fan of the project and wanted to contribute to the community in some way. Hopefully you can get some enjoyment out of these. I will be adding more as time goes on. 

I would like to point out that I don't own any of the art used in these wallpapers. Usually I'm throwing together stock photos, art book assets, fan art, etc. I do not claim any credit for the artwork in these themes unless I specifically state that it is mine. I grab assets off Google, so I'm not even sure it would be possible to credit original artists. This is just a simple project to get more wallpaper onto the MiSTer. 

I have been informed that the white "cut out" area may not line up correctly with the MiSTer menu on some displays, as the menu size changes depending on resolution. If you experience this issue and the menu does not line up correctly, I have created another folder specifically for wallpapers that do not have the menu area cut out. Unfortunately I do not have as many wallpapers for this, as many of the original .psd files were lost when my drive failed. I was able to recover some of them but not the full amount. Moving forward I will upload two versions of each wallpaper I make - one with the menu cut out (how I prefer to use them on my own set up) and one without the menu cut out (for those who need it). I would still recommend trying to use the version with the menu cut out first, as there are significantly more wallpapers available in that category
