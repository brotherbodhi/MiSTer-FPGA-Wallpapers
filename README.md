# MiSTer-FPGA-Wallpapers
1920x1080 Wallpapers for MiSTer FPGA

Here are some wallpapers I have been making for the MiSTer. I am a big fan of the project and wanted to contribute to the community in some way. Hopefully you can get some enjoyment out of these. I will be adding more as time goes on. My main priority is to make some Sega themed ones next. 

Examples of some wallpapers:
